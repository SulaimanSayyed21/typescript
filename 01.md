## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript

### Prompt 1: Create a Basic Class

**Instruction:**
Write a TypeScript class to represent a `Person`. The class should include:

- Two private properties: `name` and `age`.
- A constructor that takes two parameters: `name` (string) and `age` (number).
- A public method `introduce()` that returns a string: `Hi, I am [name] and I am [age] years old.`

### Prompt 2: Implementing Inheritance

**Instruction:**
Extend the `Person` class to create a new class called `Student`. Include:

- An additional private property: `grade` (string).
- A constructor that calls the parent class and initializes `grade`.
- A public method `study()` that returns: `I am studying in grade [grade].`
- Override the `introduce()` method to include: `Hi, I am [name], a student in grade [grade].`

### Prompt 3: Using Access Modifiers

**Instruction:**
Create a `Car` class with the following requirements:

- Three properties: `brand` (string, public), `model` (string, protected), and `year` (number, private).
- A constructor that initializes these properties.
- A public method `getCarDetails()` that returns: `This car is a [brand] [model], made in [year].`
- A subclass `ElectricCar` that adds a property `batteryCapacity` (number) and a method `charge()` that returns: `Charging [batteryCapacity] kWh battery.`

### Prompt 4: Creating Abstract Classes

**Instruction:**
Design an abstract class `Shape` with the following:

- An abstract method `area()` that returns a number.
- An abstract method `perimeter()` that returns a number.
- A concrete method `describe()` that returns: `This is a shape.`

Then, create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`:

- `Circle` should have a property `radius` and implement `area()` and `perimeter()`.
- `Rectangle` should have properties `width` and `height` and implement `area()` and `perimeter()`.

### Prompt 5: Exploring Interfaces

**Instruction:**
Define an interface `Playable` with:

- A method `play()` that returns a string.

Create two classes `Guitar` and `Piano` that implement this interface:

- `Guitar` should have a method `play()` that returns: `Strumming the guitar.`
- `Piano` should have a method `play()` that returns: `Playing the piano.`

In addition, create a function `performConcert()` that accepts an array of `Playable` objects and calls their `play()` methods sequentially.

### Prompt 6: Polymorphism with Method Overloading

**Instruction:**
Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a class `MathOperations` with overloaded methods `calculate()`:

- A method that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
- A method that takes three numbers and returns their product.

Write a TypeScript script that creates an instance of `MathOperations` and demonstrates both use cases.

### Prompt 7: Encapsulation with Getters and Setters

**Instruction:**
Create a `BankAccount` class with:

- Private properties `accountHolderName` (string) and `balance` (number).
- Getters and setters for `accountHolderName`.
- A public method `deposit(amount: number)` that adds to the balance.
- A public method `withdraw(amount: number)` that subtracts from the balance only if sufficient funds are available.

### Prompt 8: Static Methods and Properties

**Instruction:**
Create a `Calculator` class with:

- A static property `history` (array of strings) to store calculation logs.
- Static methods `add(a: number, b: number)` and `subtract(a: number, b: number)` that return results and log the operation to `history`.
- A static method `getHistory()` that returns the log of all operations.

### Prompt 9: Dependency Injection

**Instruction:**
Demonstrate dependency injection by creating:

- A `Logger` class with a method `log(message: string)` that prints messages to the console.
- A `PaymentProcessor` class that takes a `Logger` instance as a constructor parameter and has methods `processPayment(amount: number)` that logs payment processing messages using the `Logger` instance.

### Prompt 10: Working with Generics

**Instruction:**
Create a `DataStore` class using generics that:

- Has a private array `items`.
- Includes methods `addItem(item: T)` to add an item, `getItem(index: number)` to retrieve an item, and `getAllItems()` to retrieve all items.

Write a script to create instances of `DataStore` for strings and numbers, demonstrating how generics work in TypeScript.
