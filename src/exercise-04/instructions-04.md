### Prompt 3: Using Access Modifiers

**Instruction:**
Create a `Car` class with the following requirements:

- Three properties: `brand` (string, public), `model` (string, protected), and `year` (number, private).
- A constructor that initializes these properties.
- A public method `getCarDetails()` that returns: `This car is a [brand] [model], made in [year].`
- A subclass `ElectricCar` that adds a property `batteryCapacity` (number) and a method `charge()` that returns: `Charging [batteryCapacity] kWh battery.`
